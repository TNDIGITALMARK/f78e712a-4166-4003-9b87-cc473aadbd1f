  name: 'Alexandra Chen',
  tagline: 'Creating Worlds Through Color and Form',
  bio: `Alexandra Chen is a contemporary artist working across multiple mediums including oil painting, watercolor, ceramics, and mixed media. Her work explores the intersection of abstract expressionism and classical technique, creating pieces that resonate with both emotional depth and technical mastery.

Based in the Pacific Northwest, Alexandra draws inspiration from the natural landscapes surrounding her studio, as well as urban environments and human emotion. Her work has been featured in galleries across North America and is held in private collections internationally.`,

  statement: `My artistic practice is rooted in the belief that color and form possess an innate language that transcends words. Through each piece, I seek to create portals into emotional landscapesâ€”spaces where viewers can lose themselves and find new perspectives.

Whether working with the bold strokes of oil paint, the delicate transparency of watercolor, or the tactile nature of clay, I approach each medium with curiosity and respect for its unique voice. My work is an ongoing dialogue between control and spontaneity, tradition and innovation.`,
